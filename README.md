A game for the user to try to get a certain word right with the help of a hint. For every hit you get a point, for every mistake you lose a try.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- mobile first
- JSX
- ReactJS
- React hooks


### What I learned

```jsx

//Create an array of single letters. The user does not need to type twice the same letter in the word.
const uniqueLetters = [... new Set(letters)];


```

### Continued development

```
Mobile first, clean code, refactoring, ReactJS.
```

### How to run the code? 


you can download it to your machine, open the code editor terminal, go into the root folder of the project and type npm run dev. Wait for the terminal to complete and as soon as an address like 'localhost:5500/' or equivalent is shown, copy and paste that address into your browser.

or, if you want to see it working, access the deploy below:
